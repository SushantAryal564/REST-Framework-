  Token Authentication:
  This authentication scheme uses a simple token based HTTP Authentication schema. Token authentication is appropriate for client server setup, such a native desktop and mobile clients.

  To use the Token Authentication scheme you'll need to configure the authentication class to include Token Authentication and additionally inclused rest_framework.authtoken in your installed_apps setting.

  Make suere to run maange.py migrate after changing your setting. The rest_framework.authtoken app provide Django databasae migrations.

  If successful authentication, Token Authentication provide the following credentials.
  request.user will be Django user instance.
  request.auth will be a rest_framework.authtoken.models Token instance.
  Unauthenticated response that are denied permission will result in an HTTP 401
  Unauthorized response with an appropriate WWW Authnticated header.

  The http command line tool may be useful for testing token authentication API.

  If you use TokenAuthetication in production you must ensure that your API is only available in web.
